            Introduction
          </h2>
          <p>
            The introduction summarizes different types of weft knitted structures. Initially, it covers plain and purl knitting, where loops are drawn in a specific direction. It then introduces rib and interlock fabrics, which require two sets of needles and a double-ended setup to draw loops in opposite directions. Rib fabrics alternate between face and reverse loops, while interlock fabrics use four sets of needles and two feeders to interlock loops. The section concludes with the basics of tuck and float stitches, which provide additional structural variety in weft knitting.

               <h1>Characteristics of Rib Fabric:</h1><br><br>

<br>1. Elasticity: Rib knit fabric is highly stretchy, especially across the width, making it great for form-fitting garments.<br>


<br>2. Softness: It is soft and comfortable against the skin, ideal for clothing that requires flexibility.<br>


<br>3. Durability: The rib structure is strong and resilient, which helps garments retain their shape.<br>


<br>4. Thickness: It can come in various thicknesses, from lightweight to heavy, depending on the knitting pattern and yarn used.<br>


<br>5. Reversible: Rib fabric looks the same on both sides, making it versatile for many sewing projects.<br>

                        <br>1. Double-knit Structure: Interlock is essentially two layers of single jersey knit, connected together, which gives it a denser and more stable structure.<br>
                        
                        
                        <br>2. Soft and Stretchy: It has a soft, smooth texture on both sides, making it very comfortable against the skin. It also has natural stretch (in both directions), which adds to its comfort.<br>
                        
                        
                       <br> 3. Durability: The tight weave of interlock makes it resistant to pilling and wear, making it last longer than other types of knit fabrics.<br>
                        
                        
                        <br>4. Good Drape: It has a decent drape, making it suitable for garments that require a balance of structure and flow.<br>
                        
                        
                        <br>5. Doesn't Curl at the Edges: Unlike single jersey fabrics, which can roll up at the edges, interlock remains flat, making it easier to work with during sewing.<br>

              <h2>
                4.3 Tuck and Float Stitches
              </h2><br>
              <h4>
                <h3>1. Tuck Stitch</h3><br><br>

Definition: In a tuck stitch, the needle holds onto a loop for one or more rows before knitting it off with a new loop. This creates a texture where the held loops cause the fabric to gather, resulting in a thicker, more dimensional pattern.

How it works: The machine holds the stitch in place rather than knitting it immediately. This means the stitch remains on the needle while additional rows are knitted, creating extra loops on the needle. Once released, the fabric has a bumpy or waffle-like texture.

Effect on fabric: Tuck stitches add thickness and warmth to the fabric since multiple loops create a dense structure. The fabric also has more stretch and drape compared to regular stockinette.

Usage: Commonly used in designs like basketweave, honeycomb, and other textured patterns. They are also great for adding visual interest to plain knitting.
<br>
<br>
                
      
<h3>2. Float Stitch</h3><br><br>


Definition: A float (or slip) stitch occurs when the yarn floats behind the needle without being knitted for one or more stitches. This results in a strand of yarn floating across the back of the fabric, creating a contrast in texture or color.

How it works: The machine skips certain needles, leaving them unknit for a row or more, causing the yarn to float across the back. The skipped stitches don’t show up on the front side, but you can see the strands on the reverse side.

Effect on fabric: Float stitches create a smooth, less dense fabric with a bit of stretch. The floats on the back can also affect how the fabric feels against the skin. Long floats can get caught easily, so they are typically kept short or are secured in some way.

Usage: Ideal for colorwork and patterns like Fair Isle, where different colors are carried across the back of the work. It's also used to create geometric shapes and patterns by selectively floating yarns.
